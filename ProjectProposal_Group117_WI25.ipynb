    "In the fast paced, high-stakes world of professional basketball, fans, sports analysts, and front offices constantly seek to identify key indicators of a player’s long term success. Commonly, traditional stats like points per game and rebounds have long been used to assess a player’s value; however, there are advanced analytics such as player efficiency rating, box plus-minus, and true shooting percentages that offer a deeper insight into a player’s impact on the court and in the future for an NBA team. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Some prior work relevant to our research question can be found in an NBA career longevity prediction project in which the authors applied machine learning models to predict whether or not players will play at least 5 years in the NBA given by their performances within their rookie season. Critically, this project utilized more than twenty variables to understand what factors allowed players to thrive in the NBA, such as BLK (average blocks per game), OREB (average offensive rebounds per game), TOV (average turnovers per game), and a lot more. By applying these statistics to models such as SVM and logistic regression, the authors have interpreted that variables such as the amount of games played in a season and win percentage tends to contribute greater results to a team and thus one’s career in the long term. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In an additional project, an analyst sought to compare how people rank the greatest NBA players versus how a “machine” would rank the greatest NBA players based on stats. Geertsen scraped data for the people ranking portion from 3 groups: media, fans, and experts. When scraping for data in the media and expert portion Geertsen chose 8 reliable media sources’ rankings and 7 trusted experts’ rankings to use as data. For the fan portion Geertsen utilized 7 polls and weighed the results based on the number of responses to ensure the data wasn’t heavily skewed because of sample sizes. For the machine part Geertsen used ten metrics to rank every player in order to find the greatest player. Geertsen categorized these statistics into two types, a rate based category (BPM, PIPM) and a sum based category (Win Shares, Raptor JAWS). In order to more fairly calculate a player’s greatness it is important to also weigh a player’s efficiency rather than their sum as certain players had shorter careers. When comparing the machine ranking with the man ranking the lists essentially shared a similar ranking with similar players in the top 12 of each list except for one outlier that was David Robinson. With these results, Geertsen was able to learn that the statistics he used (VORP, PER, BPM, Win Shares, RAPTOR +/-, RAPTOR JAWS, CORP, WOWYR, POPM +/-, PIPM Wins Added) were a good predictor in measuring how great a player was. With great players essentially being guaranteed long careers, we can use the statistics that Ian Geertsen used in our project and see how the correlation of each statistic relates to the length of an NBA career."

    "Although our study relies on publicly available NBA player statistics based on the last 20 seasons, privacy concerns might arise on the topic of dealing with specific player information, such as injury history and external factors that might influence career longevity. Michael Beasley is a prominent example of this. Although he showed flashes of brilliance early on in his career, his lack of professionalism and off-court issues led to a shorter than expected NBA career. While our study is mainly focusing on data relating to a player’s performance, it is important to note that career longevity is affected by many variables off the court, such as a player’s personal choices as well as outside factors that are out of their control. To address privacy issues relating to data usage, we will make sure to strictly limit our analysis to publicly available statistics, and also make sure to acknowledge the limitations of our study by noting that statistical metrics alone cannot fully explain career longevity. \n",
    "The presence of bias in the data itself is also another key concern. Many statistical metrics used in the NBA like player efficiency rating, box-plus-minus, and even fantasy score, are naturally biased towards certain archetypes or playstyles. In particular, offensive contributions are far more quantifiable than defensive contributions. While a great offensive player’s impact is clearly shown in their statline, a strong defensive player’s influence on the game is not as evident just by looking at their statline. To mitigate this, we can make sure to select a diverse set of statistical metrics that look at player performance from a multitude of angles, including both traditional and more advanced stats. There may also be inherent selection bias within our data, for example, if we only focus on players with longer careers, then we might overlook players who were forced to have shorter careers than expected due to external reasons. Additionally, survivorship bias may be relevant, as players who have had long careers in the league might not be representative of all players – some of them are just inherent outliers. We cannot solely analyze players that have had long careers. To counteract this, we will make sure that our dataset includes a broad and diverse set of players, with a wide range of career lengths and various statistical metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before conducting analysis, we can rely on EDA to get a sense of how our dataset is structured as well as the underlying trends. We can examine the variable distributions in our dataset by using histograms and box plots to detect skewness and outliers, and determine whether or not to include these outliers in our analysis. On the topic of transparency, we would make sure to document decisions like these that alter the trajectory of our analysis as well as any other minor changes we make along the way to ensure our findings are replicable and free from unintended biases. Additionally, we can make sure to do a manual inspection of our dataset to observe if certain groups (e.g. bench players) are underrepresented in our dataset, and readjust our data as necessary by introducing more diversity in the dataset. \n",
    "During analysis, we can best mitigate bias by incorporating a wide variety of metrics to deter the influence of spurious correlations and confounding variables. As previously mentioned, since offensive contributions are often favored in the context of NBA statistics, we should balance our metrics by including a combination of offensive, defensive, and more advanced metrics. Some examples of defensive metrics we can utilize include steal percentage, defensive win shares, and the number of opponent points scored in the paint. Creating a balance of metrics to analyze negates the presence of bias as it allows for a nuanced analysis of players of vastly different playstyles and archetypes. We could implement separate models and utilize different features for players of different positions as well, such as placing guards, forwards, and centers in different groups to analyze. Additionally, factors like a player’s role in their team (e.g. first option, role player, bench player), playing time, injuries, and differences in the era in which a player belongs to could potentially skew our results. To account for this, we can potentially group players by era/team role and also include injury data as a variable if available. To ensure our findings are replicable and generally make sense, we can cross-validate our analysis against reputable evaluations such as advanced scouting reports and analyses. If our findings differ, then it may indicate bias in the metrics we chose to analyze, and we would be able to adjust our model accordingly. \n",
    "After analysis, it is important to evaluate how our model performs across different subgroups. Even if our model performs well overall, it might not work as well for specific groups, which is something we could either list as a limitation or improve upon if necessary. Examining the importance of each of our features is also important, as some features might appear important but not have causality when it comes to predicting career longevity – two variables can be strongly correlated but there can be no causal relationship between them. We should also strengthen our documentation by upholding transparency throughout every step of the process via documentation, from formulating a research question all the way to post-analysis. Being transparent about the presence of biases and openly addressing the limitations in our findings is vital, as well as describing the nuances of how we conducted our analysis along the way. We should also assess interpretability of our results as well as how they are interpreted by others, which ties into the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the scope of data bias, there are other ethical considerations surrounding how the results of our analysis might be interpreted or misused in a way that reinforces existing biases. We should highlight that our model is not capable of fully explaining how a player’s career longevity is determined, which is an important limitation that we must address. If NBA scouts use our findings to predict the career longevity of players, it might have a negative influence on the careers of certain players while disproportionally benefiting others. Players from underrepresented groups such as international players from overseas may face additional adversity when it comes to signing with and staying on an NBA roster. Additionally, historical biases may be inherently embedded within our data, such as traditional guidelines NBA teams have followed when recruiting new players. To mitigate these issues, we will clearly emphasize that our findings are merely for descriptive and exploratory purposes and should not be used as a strict set of guidelines to follow, and that further research should be encouraged to look at a multitude of views. Teams should consider a wide range of factors when deciding on which players to recruit, including many factors that cannot be quantified via our model. It is important to note that our model’s intent is not to be used to predict a player’s future, but rather, to examine preexisting trends based on prior data. Ultimately, this project is one that seeks to understand and uncover past trends, rather than serving as a definitive predictor of player longevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the topic of continued monitoring, as the NBA evolves over time, factors that influence career longevity today might not be as relevant in the future, making our predictions become outdated. For instance, big men like Wembanyama now shoot more threes, and being versatile at every position is becoming a necessity. To account for this, we can attempt to make it so that the dataset we use is continuously updated with newer seasons of data, allowing us to make ongoing refinements to our prediction model. We can make periodic examinations to make sure that our conclusions are logical despite ongoing changes in the NBA. Additionally, if individuals ever request for their personal information to be removed in the context of our analysis, we could establish a pipeline to do so, and update our analysis accordingly with the absence of their data, ensuring that our analysis is still robust even with the absence of certain data points. \n"
