NBA Career Arc: Predicting Longevity Through Performance Metrics is a data-driven research project analyzing which advanced basketball statistics best predict a player's career length. Using NBA player data from the past 20 seasons, we apply regression models to evaluate the impact of key metrics such as Box Plus-Minus (BPM), Win Shares (WS), and True Shooting Percentage (TS%). Our findings highlight positional differences in longevity predictors and challenge common assumptions about scoring efficiency. This project aims to provide insights into career sustainability.
